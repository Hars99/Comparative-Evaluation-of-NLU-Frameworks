# Comparative-Evaluation-of-NLU-Frameworks


As part of my assignment, I explored and experimented with **four major Natural Language Understanding (NLU) frameworks** by building a simple FAQ chatbot for each one. The objective was to understand how each platform handles customization, ease of development, and deployment.

 I have documented **my entire experience**, including setup, testing, outputs, and observations for each platform, in the uploaded file:

##  What I Did

I built the **same FAQ chatbot use case** on the following four NLU platforms:

1. **Google Dialogflow**
2. **Rasa NLU**
3. **Microsoft LUIS** (via Azure Language Studio, as LUIS is deprecated)
4. **OpenAI GPT** (using the ChatGPT API)

The chatbot was designed to respond to basic queries such as:
- “What are your working hours?”
- “How to book an appointment?”
- “Do you offer online consultations?”

##  What I Compared

For each framework, I evaluated the following:

### 1. **Customization**
- How flexible it is in defining intents, entities, and domain-specific logic.
- Whether it supports scripting or advanced behavior.

### 2. **Ease of Use**
- How easy it was to set up and build the chatbot.
- Whether it requires coding or provides a visual interface.

### 3. **Deployment**
- Whether the platform supports local, cloud, or hybrid deployment.
- SDK/API availability for integration.

##  What's in the Document

The uploaded `.docx` file contains:
- Detailed explanation of each platform.
- Step-by-step setup and usage experience.
- Observations on customization, ease of use, and deployment.
- Screenshots of working bots (where applicable).
- A final comparison table summarizing all four tools.
- A clear conclusion on which tools worked best and why.

 This file contains everything you need to understand how the four platforms compare in real-world usage with a sample chatbot use case.

##  Conclusion

Through this comparison, I got hands-on experience with different NLU frameworks. Each had its pros and cons:

- **Dialogflow**: Great for quick, visual-based bot creation.
- **Rasa**: Best for full control and offline use.
- **Azure Language Studio (CLU)**: Useful for Microsoft ecosystem but setup is tricky.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Easiest and most conversational, but lacks structured NLU components.
